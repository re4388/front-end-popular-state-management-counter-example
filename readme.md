# Frontend State Management Collection - counter example

**All code are not original by myself**, I just add some change to make a counter and add some comment to help me understand.

- Why do this?
  - I want to see most of the popular front end state management pattern, as simple as possible, to allow me to quickly see how each pattern looks like.
- How to use?
  - Go each folder to `npm install` and find the starter script in `package.json` to kick off.

ps:
I haven't take the time checking how original author is for each example, but if anyone who know and want to add the author for each sub-folder repo, feel free to do so.
