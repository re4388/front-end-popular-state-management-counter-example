# Frontend State Management Collection - counter example

**All code are not original written by myself**, just add little change and add some comment to help me understand.

- Why do this?
  - I want to see most of the popular front end state management pattern, as simple as possible, to allow me quickly how each pattern is.
- How to use?
  - Go each folder to `npm install` and find the starter script in `package.json` to kick off.

ps:
I have not take the time to check how original written these counter example, but if anyone who know and want me to add the author for each sub-folder repo, I am welcome to do so.
